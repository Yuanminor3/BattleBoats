•Group member’s names and x500s: Yuan Jiang (jian0655) & Enkhjin Boldbaatar (boldb002)
•Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner): Yuan wrote the the most of the code, Enkhjin revised and fixed bugs and defects.
•How to compile and run your program: First input the board size, then either choose 1 to see the debug mode or 2 to not see the debug mode.
Next, if you want to hit, input 2 numbers with a space in between for the coordinates. If you want to shoot a missile, type "missile"
and then the 2 coordinate numbers with a space in between. If you want to use drone, type "drone" and type in "r" or "c" depending on
whether you want to try row or column, then input which row/column(both starts at 1) you want to see.
•Any assumptions: Assumed you would input either 1 or 2 for the debug mode.
•Additional features that you implemented (if applicable): None
•Any known bugs or defects in the program: None
•Any outside sources (aside from course resources) consulted for ideas used in the project, in the format:
